#### - Correlation between the weight of the ball and the lotto number

- It's the idea of YouTube's  [ê³µì—¬ì‚¬ë“¤]
- Analysis of the winning probability of Lotto according to the weight of the ball.
- The weight of the ball is defined as the pixels of the numbers attached to the ball.
[Ball weight = sum of pixels of each number]

It used a program called ImageJ to utilize the number of black pixels. 
It is also analyzed as weight-dependent with basic analysis.

That is, the probability of each number appearing by weight is compared.

Conclusion: I lacked a lot of things because I did not study enough about data analysis.
It is a little disappointing that the weights are not utilized in various ways and are used
fragmentarily. My analysis did not produce any significant results.
